## 2026-04-16 — OR fields NULL→0.0 kills all entry evaluations

**Status:** FIXED (same day)
**Severity:** Critical — 0 trades for entire session

### Symptom
Both CPR_LEVELS LONG and SHORT sessions ran for 6 hours with 0 trades. No errors
or warnings in the log. Entry window closed with `NO_TRADES_ENTRY_WINDOW_CLOSED`.

### Root Cause
`market_day_state` is built pre-market (before the 9:15 candle exists). Three OR
OHLCV fields are always NULL at session start: `or_high_5`, `or_low_5`, `open_915`.

`_hydrate_setup_row_from_market_row` coerced these nulls to `0.0` via
`float(row[N] or 0.0)`. The live direction fallback (added after Apr 15) only
updated `direction` and `or_close_5` from the live 9:15 candle but never touched
the OR fields — they stayed at 0.0.

In `find_cpr_levels_entry` (`engine/cpr_atr_shared.py`), the first filter is:
```python
or_atr_ratio = (0.0 - 0.0) / atr = 0.0
if or_atr_ratio < 0.3:  # True → OR_ATR_RATIO rejection
```
Every symbol, every bar, silently rejected. `OR_ATR_RATIO` is a legitimate filter
code for genuinely tiny ORs so the code never warned.

### Fix Applied
`_hydrate_setup_row_from_market_row` now captures `live_intraday` from
`_build_intraday_summary(live_candles)` and backfills OR fields when DB values are 0:
```python
or_high_5 = _db_or_high or float(live_intraday.get("or_high_5") or 0.0)
or_low_5  = _db_or_low  or float(live_intraday.get("or_low_5")  or 0.0)
open_915  = _db_open    or float(live_intraday.get("open_915")   or 0.0)
```

### Files Changed
- `engine/paper_runtime.py` — `_hydrate_setup_row_from_market_row` (~line 903)

## 2026-04-16 — Zombie WebSocket causes early flatten (12:20 instead of 3:30 EOD)

**Status:** FIXED
**Severity:** Medium — positions closed early, session data valid but incomplete

### Symptom
Both sessions auto-flattened at 12:19 with 1 open position each. Feed had been
silent for 1685s (28 min) before termination, but no FEED_STALE alert was sent.

### Root Cause
The stale detection in `scripts/paper_live.py:1151` uses a 4× multiplier when the
WebSocket socket is connected:
```python
if ticker_adapter.is_connected:
    stale = elapsed > max(stale_timeout * 4, 120)  # very lenient
else:
    stale = True
```
NSE ticks stopped at ~11:51 AM but the Kite TCP socket stayed alive (no close event
from the exchange). While `is_connected=True`, the session tolerated unlimited tick
silence. At ~12:17 Kite finally closed the socket (`closes=2`). The stale check
then found 1685s elapsed and terminated immediately — no chance to send FEED_STALE
or recover.

### Proposed Fix
Cap the connected-session multiplier using `last_tick_age_sec`. A socket that is
connected but has delivered no ticks for 5 minutes is a zombie connection:

```python
# scripts/paper_live.py ~line 1151
if ticker_adapter.is_connected:
    tick_age = (ticker_adapter.get_stats() or {}).get("last_tick_age_sec") or 0
    if tick_age > 300:
        stale = elapsed > stale_timeout          # treat as disconnected
    else:
        stale = elapsed > max(stale_timeout * 4, 120)
```

Minimal one-line version — cap the multiplied threshold at 300s:
```python
if ticker_adapter.is_connected:
    stale = elapsed > min(max(stale_timeout * 4, 120), 300)
```

### Files Changed
- `scripts/paper_live.py` — stale detection block (~line 1151): added `tick_age > 300` zombie check

## 2026-04-16 — Dashboard LONG shows doubled trades and PnL (22 trades, ₹1,762)

**Status:** FIXED (data corrected + dedup guard added)
**Severity:** High — dashboard showed factually wrong numbers

### Symptom
Dashboard "Archived Sessions" showed LONG as 22 trades / ₹1,762 P&L.
Correct values: 11 trades / ₹881.24.
SHORT was correct (12 trades / −₹2,174).

### Root Cause
`store_backtest_results` in `db/backtest_db.py` is a plain `INSERT INTO` with no
deduplication. When `archive_completed_session` is called twice for the same PAPER
session, all rows are doubled. LONG was archived twice; SHORT happened to be
archived once only.

Backtest run_ids are UUIDs (unique per run), so double-archiving is impossible for
them. But PAPER run_ids are session_ids (fixed strings like
`CPR_LEVELS_LONG-2026-04-16`), so a second call silently duplicates all rows.

### Fix Applied
1. **Data corrected** — deleted duplicate rows and re-archived both sessions cleanly:
   - LONG: 11 trades, +₹881.24 ✓
   - SHORT: 12 trades, −₹2,174.40 ✓

2. **Dedup guard added** in `db/backtest_db.py store_backtest_results`:
   When `execution_mode == 'PAPER'`, delete existing rows for that `run_id` before
   inserting, making re-archive idempotent. Backtest runs are unaffected (UUID
   run_ids never collide).

### Files Changed
- `db/backtest_db.py` — `store_backtest_results` (~line 446)

## 2026-04-16 — FAILED sessions not archived, missing from dashboard dropdown

**Status:** FIXED (manually archived same day)
**Severity:** Low — data intact in paper.duckdb, just not visible in dashboard

### Symptom
Dashboard "Archived Sessions" dropdown only showed zero-trade restarted sessions.
The original FAILED sessions (23 trades total) were invisible.

### Root Cause
`archive_completed_session` is only triggered at normal COMPLETED exit. FAILED exits
(stale, crash) do not archive. The dashboard reads from `backtest.duckdb`
(`run_metadata` with `execution_mode='PAPER'`) so FAILED sessions never appeared.

### Fix Applied
Manually called `archive_completed_session` for both FAILED sessions:
- `CPR_LEVELS_LONG-2026-04-16` → 11 trades archived
- `CPR_LEVELS_SHORT-2026-04-16` → 12 trades archived

### Longer-term Fix Applied
`paper_live.py` now archives on both COMPLETED and FAILED terminal status.
`store_backtest_results` has PAPER dedup guard so re-archiving is idempotent.

### Files Changed
- `scripts/paper_live.py` — archive condition `status in ("COMPLETED", "FAILED")`

---

## 2026-04-16 — FLATTEN_EOD alert shows wrong PnL and trade count

**Status:** FIXED
**Severity:** High — Telegram EOD summary was factually incorrect (sign wrong on SHORT)

### Symptom
Telegram FLATTEN_EOD alert showed only the last auto-flattened position's PnL, not
the full session PnL. Trade count was also inflated by 1 (double-counted the
force-flattened position).

| Session | Telegram (wrong) | DB / Dashboard (correct) |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| LONG | +₹463.12, 12 trades | +₹881.24, 11 trades |
| SHORT | +₹496.22, 13 trades | −₹2,174.40, 12 trades |

The SHORT session actually had a net loss but the alert showed a gain.

### Root Cause
In `flatten_session_positions` (`engine/paper_runtime.py`), after force-closing open
positions via `update_position(status="CLOSED")`, the code re-fetched all closed
positions into `all_closed`. Because `update_position` commits before the re-fetch,
the just-flattened positions are already included in `all_closed`. But the code:
1. Added `len(closed)` again → double-counted the flattened positions
2. Only summed `total_realized` for force-closed positions; the `if not closed`
   guard meant already-closed positions were never included when a force-close ran

```python
# Bug:
total_trades = len(all_closed) + len(closed)   # double-count
if not closed and all_closed:                  # never true when force-close ran
    total_realized = sum(...)
```

### Fix Applied
```python
# Fix in engine/paper_runtime.py ~line 1325:
all_closed = await get_session_positions(session_id, statuses=["CLOSED"])
total_trades = len(all_closed)
total_realized = sum(float(p.realized_pnl or 0) for p in all_closed)
```

### Files Changed
- `engine/paper_runtime.py` — `flatten_session_positions` (~line 1325)

## 2026-04-16 — Double EOD summary (LONG + SHORT x 2)

**Status:** FIXED
**Severity:** Low

### Symptom
Four EOD alerts sent: two from FAILED original sessions (FLATTEN_EOD with position
PnL), two from restarted sessions (SESSION_COMPLETED with 0 trades).

### Root Cause
`--multi` auto-restarts failed variants with a new `session_id` suffix. Restarted
sessions start after 10:15, find entry window closed, exit immediately, and send
their own SESSION_COMPLETED alert.

### Fix Applied
Inside `flatten_session_positions`: if `total_trades == 0 and not closed`, skip
the FLATTEN_EOD dispatch entirely — zero-trade restart sessions have nothing to
report. Also fixed the dedup check to match on `body LIKE session_id[:24]` instead
of subject (subject is date-only and doesn't contain the session_id).

### Files Changed
- `engine/paper_runtime.py` — `flatten_session_positions` dedup + zero-trade guard

## 2026-04-16 — Apr 15 Telegram alerts all failed (error_msg='None')

**Status:** PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
**Severity:** Medium — no operational impact on Apr 15 but alert system is critical

### Symptom
All `alert_log` rows for 2026-04-15 sessions have `status='failed'` and
`error_msg='None'` (the string, not SQL NULL). Zero Telegram messages received.

### Root Cause Analysis
`error_msg = str(last_error) if status == "failed" else None`

`str(None) = 'None'` means `last_error` was never assigned — i.e., no send was
attempted at all. This only happens when `telegram.enabled = False` AND
`email.enabled = False`. `telegram.enabled = bool(bot_token and chat_ids)`, so
either `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or `TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS` was empty/missing at session
start on Apr 15.

Note: changing the chat ID to an invalid value would produce a Telegram API error
exception, not a silent no-attempt. `error_msg='None'` rules out a wrong-chat-ID
scenario.

### Current State
Apr 16 restart (12:20) used updated Doppler config — all 15 Telegram sends returned
HTTP 200. Alert system confirmed working.

### Fix Applied
`AlertDispatcher.start()` now logs:
```
AlertDispatcher started: telegram.enabled=True chat_ids=1 email.enabled=False
```
This makes alert config visible in the log at session start for post-mortem diagnosis.

### Files Changed
- `engine/alert_dispatcher.py` — `start()` method

## 2026-04-15 — Direction resolution race — SHORT died at 09:25 with NO_ACTIVE_SYMBOLS

**Status:** FIXED (before 2026-04-16 session)
**Severity:** Critical — SHORT session lost entire day

### Summary
`CPR_LEVELS_SHORT-2026-04-15` completed with `NO_ACTIVE_SYMBOLS` at 09:25.
LONG survived by coincidence (5 early-tick resolutions all happened to be LONG).

### Root Cause
`strategy_day_state` had `direction_5 = 'NONE'` for all 2095 symbols — pre-market
state build did not populate directions. At session prefetch time (09:20:29-30,
after three crashes and restarts), Kite WebSocket ticks were still sparse:
- 5 symbols resolved (all LONG from closed-above-TC)
- 0 symbols resolved SHORT
- 592 symbols stayed NONE → rejected by `should_process_symbol`

The session had been started before the pre-market WebSocket segment flip
(09:10 → 09:15), causing sparse ticks at direction-resolution time.

### Fix Applied
`MARKET_READY_HHMM = "09:16"` auto-sleep in `scripts/paper_trading.py:1051`.
Sessions started before 09:16 now wait until exactly 09:16, after the segment flip,
ensuring the 9:15 candle is closed before direction resolution runs.

### Remaining Open Actions (from original incident log)
1. **Direction-readiness gate** — delay Stage B until coverage ≥80% or bar 09:25
2. **EOD pipeline** — guarantee `strategy_day_state` for T+1 is built with ATR
   every EOD (never left to morning-of refresh)
3. **Kite WebSocket auto-reconnect** — `_on_close(None, None)` silently clears
   `_connected`. Add reconnect with backoff, per-minute health log, tick-coverage
   alerts (`engine/kite_ticker_adapter.py:328-330`)
4. **DQ readiness gate** — extend `pivot-data-quality --date today` to verify
   `strategy_day_state` direction coverage, not just table presence

## 2026-04-13 — MANOMAY live vs replay fill divergence

**Status:** PARTIALLY ADDRESSED — feed audit implemented, deeper analysis pending
**Severity:** High — same symbol, same session, different PnL outcome

### Summary
`MANOMAY` SHORT on 2026-04-13:
- Live session alert: `221.49 → 216.31`, TARGET, `+₹2,253`
- Replay/local-backtest after cleanup: `220.90 → 220.90`, BREAKEVEN_SL, `-₹83.49`

### Root Cause Hypothesis
Live WebSocket path builds 5-min candles from real ticks. Replay/local-live use
candles from `intraday_day_pack` (EOD-built). The historical pack does not
preserve the exact live fill snapshot, so fill prices and bar shapes can diverge.
A single-bar fill drift is enough to flip a TARGET win into a BREAKEVEN loss.

### Fix Applied
`paper_feed_audit` table now stores one compact row per
`session_id + symbol + 5-min bucket`. Compare via:
```bash
pivot-paper-trading feed-audit --trade-date YYYY-MM-DD --feed-source kite
```

### Pending Analysis
- Verify whether WebSocket path falls back to receive-time when
  `exchange_timestamp` is missing or late
- Confirm live volume reconstruction from cumulative `volume_traded` is correct
- Decide whether feed-audit tolerates OHLC drift or whether the live candle
  builder needs a stronger timestamp contract before trusting live-vs-pack parity
- 2026-04-15 audit: large real drift vs `intraday_day_pack` confirmed, mostly in
  volume with some OHLC mismatches (after fixing the bar_start vs bar_end join key)

## 2026-04-16 — paper_positions.exit_reason is NULL for all positions

**Status:** FIXED
**Severity:** Low — data still usable but exit reason audit was missing

### Symptom
All 23 positions from today's LONG and SHORT sessions have `exit_reason=None` in
`paper_positions`. Exit reasons (SL_HIT, TARGET_HIT, TRAIL_STOP, MANUAL_FLATTEN,
BREAKEVEN_SL) were not being persisted to the DB column.

### Root Cause
`update_position` in `db/paper_db.py` accepts two separate keyword arguments:
`exit_reason` (writes `exit_reason` column) and `closed_by` (writes `closed_by` column).
All four close call-sites in `engine/paper_runtime.py` only passed `closed_by=exit_reason`
— the `exit_reason=` keyword was never passed, so the column always stayed NULL.

The `paper_positions` schema has both columns (`exit_reason VARCHAR(50)` and
`closed_by VARCHAR(50)`) — both exist, but only `closed_by` was being populated.

### Fix Applied
Added `exit_reason=<reason>` to all four `update_position` close call-sites:
1. Manual flatten path (`closed_by="MANUAL_FLATTEN"`) — `engine/paper_runtime.py` ~line 1280
2. SL hit path (`closed_by=exit_reason`) — ~line 1717
3. Scale-out TARGET path (`closed_by="TARGET"`) — ~line 1792
4. Resolved exit path (`closed_by=resolved_exit_reason`) — ~line 1930

### Files Changed
- `engine/paper_runtime.py` — four `update_position` call-sites

## 2026-04-15 / 2026-04-16 — Live candle OHLCV diverges from intraday_day_pack

**Status:** ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED — volume bug fixed, residual OHLC drift is architectural
**Severity:** Medium — volume bug caused false mismatches; residual OHLC drift is inherent and
understood. Does not affect SL/target monitoring (uses LTP directly). May cause occasional
entry fill differences vs replay.

### Symptom

Apr 15 feed audit (`pivot-paper-trading feed-audit --trade-date 2026-04-15 --feed-source kite`):
- Total rows: 2433 | Exact matches: 55 | Unmatched: 2342
- Field mismatches: open=1391, high=1262, low=1278, close=1548, volume=2333
- Volume virtually always wrong; OHLC also largely wrong

Apr 16 feed audit (bar-by-bar breakdown):

| Bar | Syms | PriceOK% | VolOK% | Vol Inflated |
|-----|------|----------|--------|--------------|
| 10:10 (first — session started at 10:07, mid-bar) | 1573 | 20% | 0% | 89% |
| 10:15 (first complete bar) | 1596 | 41% | 33% | ~0% |
| 10:20 (steady state begins) | 880 | 76% | 86% | 0% |
| 10:25+ (steady state) | ~877 | 20–100% | 10–100% | 0% |
| 12:25 (flush on stale terminate) | 1581 | 74% | 0% | 87% |

### Root Cause — Two Separate Problems

#### Problem 1: First-tick volume inflation (BUG — now FIXED)

`volume_traded` from Kite WebSocket is cumulative since market open. When the session
connects (e.g. at 10:07), the first tick for each symbol has `prev = None` so the delta
computation fell back to `max(0.0, cumulative)` — attributing ALL pre-session volume
(from 9:15 to 10:07) to the first live bar. This produced volumes 10–1000× higher than
the historical pack. Accounts for the vast majority of Apr 15 volume mismatches (2333/2433).

Same inflation happens at session terminate: flushed partial bars inherit stale
`_prev_cumulative_vol` from the last real tick, so the 12:25 flush bar also had 87%
inflated volume. That data is discarded anyway.

**Fix applied** (`engine/live_market_data.py`): when `prev is None`, leave
`bar_volume_delta = 0.0` instead of using the full cumulative.

#### Problem 2: Residual OHLC drift (~15–25% at steady state) — ARCHITECTURAL, NOT A BUG

Even after the volume fix, ~15–25% of OHLC values differ from the historical pack.
This is an inherent difference between the two data sources — **not a Kite bug, not our bug**.

**Why live WebSocket and Kite historical differ even though both come from Kite:**

| | Kite WebSocket (live) | Kite Historical API (pack) |
|--|--|--|
| What it sends | LTP quote updates — one tick per price change | Full tick reconstruction — every trade aggregated server-side |
| Bar open | First `last_price` tick received after bar start | First actual trade of the bar on exchange |
| Bar high/low | Max/min of ticks WE received | True high/low of ALL trades in bar |
| Bar volume | Cumulative delta between ticks we received | Exact per-bar volume from exchange |

We subscribe in **MODE_QUOTE** (`kite_ticker_adapter.py`). This delivers one WebSocket
update per price change — not every individual trade. In a liquid symbol, 50 trades can
happen in 200ms at different prices; Kite delivers 2–3 ticks covering that burst. We only
see the last price of the burst, not the extremes.

Consequences:
- **Open**: Our first tick after 9:20:00 may arrive at 9:20:02 and may not be the actual
  first trade. The historical API has the exact first trade at 9:20:00.
- **High/Low**: We miss intra-burst price extremes between consecutive WebSocket deliveries.
- **Close**: Usually matches well — last tick before bar end is typically captured.

This is why low-liquidity symbols nearly match (CANFINHOME: entry 857.72 vs 857.72 — exact)
while liquid symbols diverge (ABFRL: our vol=1,788,322 vs historical 33,096 before fix).

**The residual ~15–25% mismatch after the volume fix is not fixable** without switching
the candle source to Kite historical 1-min candles polled every 1–2 minutes, which would
replace WebSocket-built candles with authoritative data.

#### Problem 3: First bar always incomplete (structural limitation)

When the session connects mid-bar (e.g. at 10:07 during the 10:05–10:10 bar):
- OHLC open = first tick received at 10:07, NOT the actual open at 10:05
- All prior trades (10:05–10:07) are invisible

For Apr 16 this affected the 10:10 bar (89% vol inflated, 20% price match). This is
unavoidable — we cannot reconstruct trades we didn't observe. Since entry window is
9:20–10:15 and sessions start before 9:16, in normal operation the first bar affected
is the 9:20 bar (session connects at ~9:07, the 9:15 bar starts at 9:15:00 — we should
be connected before the first trade).

### Impact on Trading

- **SL and target monitoring**: Not affected. SL/target checks use LTP directly from
  WebSocket, not candle OHLC. No fix needed here.
- **Entry signals**: Entry fires on candle close. A 0.1–0.5% open/close divergence may
  occasionally push a symbol across or below the entry threshold compared to historical.
  This explains why the same symbol can show a different entry price or miss entry
  entirely between live and local-live sessions.
- **PnL divergence**: Entry price differences cascade into PnL differences. Expected.
  Example: HGS LONG — live entry 410.75 (TRAILING_SL +₹463), local-live 411.15 (TIME +₹1,089).

### Fixes Applied

1. **Volume inflation** (`engine/live_market_data.py`): First-tick `bar_volume_delta = 0.0`
   instead of `max(0.0, cumulative)`.

2. **exchange_timestamp fallback logged** (`engine/kite_ticker_adapter.py`): DEBUG log
   per batch when receive-time fallback fires. Lets us monitor how often exchange_timestamp
   is missing (missed timestamps near bar boundaries cause bucket misassignment).

3. **Audit tooling** (commits `fcba0ca`, `e3aba01`): `scripts/paper_feed_audit.py` reports
   per-field mismatches (open, high, low, close, volume separately) and is feed-source aware
   (Kite joins on `bar_start`; replay/local joins on `bar_end`).

### Remaining / Future Work

- **Potential improvement**: Poll Kite historical 1-min candles every 60s as authoritative
  candle source for entry decisions; keep WebSocket for LTP-only SL/target monitoring.
  This would eliminate residual OHLC drift at the cost of 60s entry latency.
- Monitor exchange_timestamp fallback rate tomorrow via DEBUG logs.
- Apr 15 zombie gap (11:51–12:17 — no ticks): missing ticks never recovered after
  reconnect — pack has full data, live has a gap. Contributes to the Apr 15 divergence
  count on top of the volume bug.
