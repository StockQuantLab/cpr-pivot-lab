# Issues and Fixes Log

This is the single consolidated record of all bugs, incidents, and fixes for the live
paper trading system. Every new issue or fix must be documented here going forward.

## 2026-04-20 — BUG: Telegram 429 rate-limit drops alert permanently at burst open

**Status:** FIXED — `engine/alert_dispatcher.py`
**Severity:** Medium — 1 TRADE_OPENED alert lost (MVGJL SHORT); no trading impact

### Root Cause
At 09:25, the 9:25 bar fired a burst of ~20 alerts simultaneously (10 SL_HIT + new TRADE_OPENED
for both LONG and SHORT sessions). Telegram's bot API limit is **20 messages/minute per chat**.
MVGJL SHORT OPENED (alert_log ID 1042) was message 21, got a `429 Too Many Requests`.

The existing retry logic used fixed backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s (7s total). Telegram's response body
specified `retry_after: 26` — all 3 retries fired within the cooldown window and also got 429.
Alert was permanently dropped (`status=failed`, `channel=BOTH`).

### Fix
`AlertDispatcher._send_with_retry` now extracts the server-specified wait from the 429 response:
1. Checks `response.json()["parameters"]["retry_after"]` (Telegram-specific field)
2. Falls back to standard `Retry-After` HTTP header
3. If found, sleeps exactly that duration before retry; logs a WARNING with the wait time
4. If not found, falls back to the existing fixed `RETRY_BACKOFF`

### Files Changed
- `engine/alert_dispatcher.py` — `_send_with_retry` + `_telegram_retry_after` static helper

---

## 2026-04-20 — BUG: Duplicate FLATTEN_EOD Telegram alert at EOD

**Status:** FIXED — `engine/paper_runtime.py`
**Severity:** Medium — double Telegram noise, no trading impact

### Root Cause
`flatten_session_positions` deduped via `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM alert_log WHERE alert_type='FLATTEN_EOD'`.
`_dispatch_alert` is fire-and-forget — `log_alert` writes to `alert_log` AFTER the Telegram POST
completes, inside the async consumer loop. Any two concurrent (or near-simultaneous) callers both
see 0 before either write commits, so both dispatch.

On 2026-04-20, `CPR_LEVELS_SHORT` had EMKAY close at TARGET at 15:10 as the last open position.
The session exit triggered `flatten_session_positions` with the dedup window still open, resulting
in two FLATTEN_EOD items queued (alert_log IDs 1157 and 1158, sent 360ms apart).

### Fix
Replaced DB dedup with a module-level `_flatten_eod_sent: set[str]` in `paper_runtime.py`.
The set is updated synchronously (`_flatten_eod_sent.add(session_id)`) before `_dispatch_alert`
is called, making it immune to async timing. `_flatten_eod_sent` persists for the process lifetime
so cross-session dedup also works (e.g., resume sessions).

## 2026-04-20 — FEATURE: Progressive trail stop between 1R and T1 (pre-target ratchet)

**Status:** PENDING — backtest analysis required
**Severity:** Enhancement — prevents giving back unrealised gains when position stalls before target

### Problem
Current trail design has a dead zone between BREAKEVEN (1R) and TARGET (T1):
- At 1R: SL moves to entry (scratch protection only)
- At T1: ATR trail begins
- **Between 1R and T1: SL sits flat at entry regardless of how far price has moved**

Example (2026-04-20 EMKAY SHORT):
- Entry 241.16, SL 243.44, Target 232.15 (3.93R away)
- Price reached 237.7 (+1.51R, unrealised +₹1,428)
- If price reverses to entry → BREAKEVEN_SL fires → -₹83 scratch
- Position gave back entire ₹1,428 unrealised gain for a scratch exit

On days where SHORT entries move 1–1.5R but never reach T1, every trade ends as a scratch
or initial SL. The trail never activates because the target is too far. LONG avoids this
on good days because T1 gets hit early and the ATR trail captures the extension.

### Proposed Solution: ratchet trail after 1R

Add `trail_after_r` parameter — once position reaches N×R, start trailing at 1×ATR from
best price immediately (instead of waiting for T1):

```
Entry 241.16, risk = 2.28/share
  1.0R (238.88) → SL to entry (current — BREAKEVEN)
  1.5R (237.72) → SL to +0.5R locked  ← new ratchet step
  2.0R (236.56) → SL to +1.0R locked  ← new ratchet step
  T1 hit        → ATR trail (current behaviour continues)
```

### Implementation Plan
1. **SQL analysis first**: query baseline SHORT run (`23376249a6ca`, 2025-01-01→2026-04-17).
   For each trade that closed BREAKEVEN_SL: check max_excursion vs 1R. Count how many
   reached 1.5R+ before reversing. Estimate P&L improvement with ratchet.
2. **Backtest flag**: `--trail-after-r 1.5` on `pivot-backtest` (default disabled).
3. **Sweep**: test 1.0 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 2.0 thresholds. Check Calmar vs baseline.
4. **Paper parity**: add to both engines before enabling in live.

### Notes
- Only affects trades that pass BREAKEVEN but don't reach T1 (the "stalled" trades)
- Risk: cutting winners short if 1.5R dip is just noise before the big move to T1
- Asymmetric impact: SHORT benefits more than LONG on range-bound days
- Pairs well with the 10:15 win-rate checkpoint (complementary, not redundant)

## 2026-04-20 — FEATURE: 10:15 intraday win-rate checkpoint to flatten losing sessions early

**Status:** PENDING — implement at EOD
**Severity:** Enhancement — reduces drawdown on bad market days

### Problem
On bearish days (like 2026-04-20), the SHORT session opens many trades that go against it.
By 10:15 (entry window close), the session's intraday win rate is already below its
long-run baseline (~33%). Remaining open positions have unrealized profit but keep bleeding
as the market whipsaws. Continuing to 15:15 turns a small loss into a large one.

Simply closing all sessions at 10:15 is too blunt — on a good day (LONG today), the
trailing phase (10:15→15:15) generates the biggest winners (INTERARCH +₹2,326, THERMAX
+₹1,652). We need a per-session, market-adaptive signal.

### Proposed Solution: intraday win-rate checkpoint

At 10:15 (entry window close), independently evaluate each session:

```
intraday_win_rate = winning_closed_trades / total_closed_trades (up to 10:15)

if intraday_win_rate < checkpoint_winrate_threshold:
    flatten all remaining open positions at current market price
    emit CHECKPOINT_FLATTEN alert
else:
    continue to 15:15 TIME_EXIT as normal
```

**Why win rate vs rupee threshold:**
- Win rate is relative to the strategy's known edge — it's market-condition adaptive
- A rupee threshold is position-size dependent (breaks with risk-based sizing)
- Win rate < baseline (33%) = "strategy edge not present today" = clear exit signal
- Each session (LONG, SHORT) evaluated independently — good session continues, bad exits

### Example (2026-04-20 SHORT at 10:15):
- 32 closed trades, win rate likely ~20-25% (several INITIAL_SL hits vs targets)
- Threshold = 30% → flatten 6 remaining open positions at ~10:15 price
- Locks unrealized +₹1,954 instead of watching it bleed to 15:15

### Implementation Plan
1. **SQL analysis first** (no code changes): query `backtest_results` for existing baseline
   run, simulate checkpoint at different thresholds (0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.33, 0.40).
   Compare Calmar vs baseline. Do SHORT first (today's pain), then LONG.

2. **Engine flag** (if SQL shows Calmar improvement > 10%):
   - `--checkpoint-winrate-threshold 0.30` on both `pivot-backtest` and `daily-live`
   - In `paper_session_driver.py`: `on_entry_window_close()` hook
   - In backtest engine: mid-day session-level aggregation at 10:15 bar
   - Must be added to BOTH engines for paper parity

3. **Sweep** with `pivot-sweep` YAML across threshold values per direction.

### Notes
- Default = disabled (current behavior preserved)
- Backtest parity required before enabling in live — do not add paper-only
- Only valid at entry window close (10:15) — not a rolling intraday check

## 2026-04-20 — `get_stats` AttributeError crashes both sessions at market open

**Status:** FIXED (same day, ~9:18 AM)
**Severity:** Critical — both LONG and SHORT sessions crashed on first candle bar

### Symptom
Both CPR_LEVELS LONG and SHORT sessions connected to WebSocket successfully at 9:16 AM,
processed the first Stage B direction filter, then immediately crashed with:
```
AttributeError: 'KiteTickerAdapter' object has no attribute 'get_stats'.
Did you mean: 'health_stats'?
```
Both variants entered the retry loop (2/5, 3/5...) but all retries failed with the same error.
Sessions were in ACTIVE state in paper.duckdb but not processing any bars.

### Root Cause
`scripts/paper_live.py:1168` called `ticker_adapter.get_stats()` inside the zombie-check
block (stale WebSocket detection). The method was renamed to `health_stats()` in
`engine/kite_ticker_adapter.py` but the call site in `paper_live.py` was not updated.

```python
# Before (broken):
tick_age = (ticker_adapter.get_stats() or {}).get("last_tick_age_sec") or 0
# After (fixed):
tick_age = (ticker_adapter.health_stats() or {}).get("last_tick_age_sec") or 0
```

### Fix Applied
`scripts/paper_live.py:1168`: `get_stats()` → `health_stats()`.
Session restarted at 9:18 AM, both variants reconnected, caught the 9:20 entry bar.

### Impact
9:15 and first half of 9:20 bar missed. No trades lost — entry window runs to 10:15 AM
and the 9:20 bar was caught in full after restart.

## 2026-04-20 — Daily startup confusion: separate LONG/SHORT processes fail on Windows

**Status:** Documented (process issue, not code bug)
**Severity:** Operational — wasted ~15 minutes before market open

### Symptom
Attempting to start two separate `daily-live` processes (one `--preset CPR_LEVELS_RISK_LONG`,
one `--preset CPR_LEVELS_RISK_SHORT`) fails: the second process crashes immediately with
`IOException: paper.duckdb is already open by PID N`.

### Root Cause
DuckDB on Windows uses OS-level exclusive file locking. Two separate `daily-live` processes
both try to open `paper.duckdb` in read-write mode. The second process always fails.

### Fix / Canonical Command
Always use `--multi` — runs both LONG and SHORT in one process with a single DB writer.
`--multi` uses `PAPER_STANDARD_MATRIX` which hardcodes `CPR_CANONICAL_PARAMS` (= RISK sizing).
`--risk-based-sizing` flag is redundant with `--multi` but harmless.

```bash
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 doppler run -- uv run pivot-paper-trading daily-live \
  --multi --strategy CPR_LEVELS --trade-date today --all-symbols \
  >> .tmp_logs/live_YYYYMMDD.log 2>&1
```

## 2026-04-16 — OR fields NULL→0.0 kills all entry evaluations

**Status:** FIXED (same day)
**Severity:** Critical — 0 trades for entire session

### Symptom
Both CPR_LEVELS LONG and SHORT sessions ran for 6 hours with 0 trades. No errors
or warnings in the log. Entry window closed with `NO_TRADES_ENTRY_WINDOW_CLOSED`.

### Root Cause
`market_day_state` is built pre-market (before the 9:15 candle exists). Three OR
OHLCV fields are always NULL at session start: `or_high_5`, `or_low_5`, `open_915`.

`_hydrate_setup_row_from_market_row` coerced these nulls to `0.0` via
`float(row[N] or 0.0)`. The live direction fallback (added after Apr 15) only
updated `direction` and `or_close_5` from the live 9:15 candle but never touched
the OR fields — they stayed at 0.0.

In `find_cpr_levels_entry` (`engine/cpr_atr_shared.py`), the first filter is:
```python
or_atr_ratio = (0.0 - 0.0) / atr = 0.0
if or_atr_ratio < 0.3:  # True → OR_ATR_RATIO rejection
```
Every symbol, every bar, silently rejected. `OR_ATR_RATIO` is a legitimate filter
code for genuinely tiny ORs so the code never warned.

### Fix Applied
`_hydrate_setup_row_from_market_row` now captures `live_intraday` from
`_build_intraday_summary(live_candles)` and backfills OR fields when DB values are 0:
```python
or_high_5 = _db_or_high or float(live_intraday.get("or_high_5") or 0.0)
or_low_5  = _db_or_low  or float(live_intraday.get("or_low_5")  or 0.0)
open_915  = _db_open    or float(live_intraday.get("open_915")   or 0.0)
```

### Files Changed
- `engine/paper_runtime.py` — `_hydrate_setup_row_from_market_row` (~line 903)

## 2026-04-16 — Zombie WebSocket causes early flatten (12:20 instead of 3:30 EOD)

**Status:** FIXED
**Severity:** Medium — positions closed early, session data valid but incomplete

### Symptom
Both sessions auto-flattened at 12:19 with 1 open position each. Feed had been
silent for 1685s (28 min) before termination, but no FEED_STALE alert was sent.

### Root Cause
The stale detection in `scripts/paper_live.py:1151` uses a 4× multiplier when the
WebSocket socket is connected:
```python
if ticker_adapter.is_connected:
    stale = elapsed > max(stale_timeout * 4, 120)  # very lenient
else:
    stale = True
```
NSE ticks stopped at ~11:51 AM but the Kite TCP socket stayed alive (no close event
from the exchange). While `is_connected=True`, the session tolerated unlimited tick
silence. At ~12:17 Kite finally closed the socket (`closes=2`). The stale check
then found 1685s elapsed and terminated immediately — no chance to send FEED_STALE
or recover.

### Proposed Fix
Cap the connected-session multiplier using `last_tick_age_sec`. A socket that is
connected but has delivered no ticks for 5 minutes is a zombie connection:

```python
# scripts/paper_live.py ~line 1151
if ticker_adapter.is_connected:
    tick_age = (ticker_adapter.get_stats() or {}).get("last_tick_age_sec") or 0
    if tick_age > 300:
        stale = elapsed > stale_timeout          # treat as disconnected
    else:
        stale = elapsed > max(stale_timeout * 4, 120)
```

Minimal one-line version — cap the multiplied threshold at 300s:
```python
if ticker_adapter.is_connected:
    stale = elapsed > min(max(stale_timeout * 4, 120), 300)
```

### Files Changed
- `scripts/paper_live.py` — stale detection block (~line 1151): added `tick_age > 300` zombie check

## 2026-04-16 — Dashboard LONG shows doubled trades and PnL (22 trades, ₹1,762)

**Status:** FIXED (data corrected + dedup guard added)
**Severity:** High — dashboard showed factually wrong numbers

### Symptom
Dashboard "Archived Sessions" showed LONG as 22 trades / ₹1,762 P&L.
Correct values: 11 trades / ₹881.24.
SHORT was correct (12 trades / −₹2,174).

### Root Cause
`store_backtest_results` in `db/backtest_db.py` is a plain `INSERT INTO` with no
deduplication. When `archive_completed_session` is called twice for the same PAPER
session, all rows are doubled. LONG was archived twice; SHORT happened to be
archived once only.

Backtest run_ids are UUIDs (unique per run), so double-archiving is impossible for
them. But PAPER run_ids are session_ids (fixed strings like
`CPR_LEVELS_LONG-2026-04-16`), so a second call silently duplicates all rows.

### Fix Applied
1. **Data corrected** — deleted duplicate rows and re-archived both sessions cleanly:
   - LONG: 11 trades, +₹881.24 ✓
   - SHORT: 12 trades, −₹2,174.40 ✓

2. **Dedup guard added** in `db/backtest_db.py store_backtest_results`:
   When `execution_mode == 'PAPER'`, delete existing rows for that `run_id` before
   inserting, making re-archive idempotent. Backtest runs are unaffected (UUID
   run_ids never collide).

### Files Changed
- `db/backtest_db.py` — `store_backtest_results` (~line 446)

---

## 2026-04-16 — FAILED sessions not archived, missing from dashboard dropdown

**Status:** FIXED (manually archived same day)
**Severity:** Low — data intact in paper.duckdb, just not visible in dashboard

### Symptom
Dashboard "Archived Sessions" dropdown only showed zero-trade restarted sessions.
The original FAILED sessions (23 trades total) were invisible.

### Root Cause
`archive_completed_session` is only triggered at normal COMPLETED exit. FAILED exits
(stale, crash) do not archive. The dashboard reads from `backtest.duckdb`
(`run_metadata` with `execution_mode='PAPER'`) so FAILED sessions never appeared.

### Fix Applied
Manually called `archive_completed_session` for both FAILED sessions:
- `CPR_LEVELS_LONG-2026-04-16` → 11 trades archived
- `CPR_LEVELS_SHORT-2026-04-16` → 12 trades archived

### Longer-term Fix Applied
`paper_live.py` now archives on both COMPLETED and FAILED terminal status.
`store_backtest_results` has PAPER dedup guard so re-archiving is idempotent.

### Files Changed
- `scripts/paper_live.py` — archive condition `status in ("COMPLETED", "FAILED")`

---

## 2026-04-16 — FLATTEN_EOD alert shows wrong PnL and trade count

**Status:** FIXED
**Severity:** High — Telegram EOD summary was factually incorrect (sign wrong on SHORT)

### Symptom
Telegram FLATTEN_EOD alert showed only the last auto-flattened position's PnL, not
the full session PnL. Trade count was also inflated by 1 (double-counted the
force-flattened position).

| Session | Telegram (wrong) | DB / Dashboard (correct) |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| LONG | +₹463.12, 12 trades | +₹881.24, 11 trades |
| SHORT | +₹496.22, 13 trades | −₹2,174.40, 12 trades |

The SHORT session actually had a net loss but the alert showed a gain.

### Root Cause
In `flatten_session_positions` (`engine/paper_runtime.py`), after force-closing open
positions via `update_position(status="CLOSED")`, the code re-fetched all closed
positions into `all_closed`. Because `update_position` commits before the re-fetch,
the just-flattened positions are already included in `all_closed`. But the code:
1. Added `len(closed)` again → double-counted the flattened positions
2. Only summed `total_realized` for force-closed positions; the `if not closed`
   guard meant already-closed positions were never included when a force-close ran

```python
# Bug:
total_trades = len(all_closed) + len(closed)   # double-count
if not closed and all_closed:                  # never true when force-close ran
    total_realized = sum(...)
```

### Fix Applied
```python
# Fix in engine/paper_runtime.py ~line 1325:
all_closed = await get_session_positions(session_id, statuses=["CLOSED"])
total_trades = len(all_closed)
total_realized = sum(float(p.realized_pnl or 0) for p in all_closed)
```

### Files Changed
- `engine/paper_runtime.py` — `flatten_session_positions` (~line 1325)

---

## 2026-04-16 — Double EOD summary (LONG + SHORT x 2)

**Status:** FIXED
**Severity:** Low

### Symptom
Four EOD alerts sent: two from FAILED original sessions (FLATTEN_EOD with position
PnL), two from restarted sessions (SESSION_COMPLETED with 0 trades).

### Root Cause
`--multi` auto-restarts failed variants with a new `session_id` suffix. Restarted
sessions start after 10:15, find entry window closed, exit immediately, and send
their own SESSION_COMPLETED alert.

### Fix Applied
Inside `flatten_session_positions`: if `total_trades == 0 and not closed`, skip
the FLATTEN_EOD dispatch entirely — zero-trade restart sessions have nothing to
report. Also fixed the dedup check to match on `body LIKE session_id[:24]` instead
of subject (subject is date-only and doesn't contain the session_id).

### Files Changed
- `engine/paper_runtime.py` — `flatten_session_positions` dedup + zero-trade guard

---

## 2026-04-16 — Apr 15 Telegram alerts all failed (error_msg='None')

**Status:** PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
**Severity:** Medium — no operational impact on Apr 15 but alert system is critical

### Symptom
All `alert_log` rows for 2026-04-15 sessions have `status='failed'` and
`error_msg='None'` (the string, not SQL NULL). Zero Telegram messages received.

### Root Cause Analysis
`error_msg = str(last_error) if status == "failed" else None`

`str(None) = 'None'` means `last_error` was never assigned — i.e., no send was
attempted at all. This only happens when `telegram.enabled = False` AND
`email.enabled = False`. `telegram.enabled = bool(bot_token and chat_ids)`, so
either `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or `TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS` was empty/missing at session
start on Apr 15.

Note: changing the chat ID to an invalid value would produce a Telegram API error
exception, not a silent no-attempt. `error_msg='None'` rules out a wrong-chat-ID
scenario.

### Current State
Apr 16 restart (12:20) used updated Doppler config — all 15 Telegram sends returned
HTTP 200. Alert system confirmed working.

### Fix Applied
`AlertDispatcher.start()` now logs:
```
AlertDispatcher started: telegram.enabled=True chat_ids=1 email.enabled=False
```
This makes alert config visible in the log at session start for post-mortem diagnosis.

### Files Changed
- `engine/alert_dispatcher.py` — `start()` method

## 2026-04-15 — Direction resolution race — SHORT died at 09:25 with NO_ACTIVE_SYMBOLS

**Status:** FIXED (before 2026-04-16 session)
**Severity:** Critical — SHORT session lost entire day

### Summary
`CPR_LEVELS_SHORT-2026-04-15` completed with `NO_ACTIVE_SYMBOLS` at 09:25.
LONG survived by coincidence (5 early-tick resolutions all happened to be LONG).

### Root Cause
`strategy_day_state` had `direction_5 = 'NONE'` for all 2095 symbols — pre-market
state build did not populate directions. At session prefetch time (09:20:29-30,
after three crashes and restarts), Kite WebSocket ticks were still sparse:
- 5 symbols resolved (all LONG from closed-above-TC)
- 0 symbols resolved SHORT
- 592 symbols stayed NONE → rejected by `should_process_symbol`

The session had been started before the pre-market WebSocket segment flip
(09:10 → 09:15), causing sparse ticks at direction-resolution time.

### Fix Applied
`MARKET_READY_HHMM = "09:16"` auto-sleep in `scripts/paper_trading.py:1051`.
Sessions started before 09:16 now wait until exactly 09:16, after the segment flip,
ensuring the 9:15 candle is closed before direction resolution runs.

### Remaining Open Actions (from original incident log)
1. **Direction-readiness gate** — delay Stage B until coverage ≥80% or bar 09:25
2. **EOD pipeline** — guarantee `strategy_day_state` for T+1 is built with ATR
   every EOD (never left to morning-of refresh)
3. **Kite WebSocket auto-reconnect** — `_on_close(None, None)` silently clears
   `_connected`. Add reconnect with backoff, per-minute health log, tick-coverage
   alerts (`engine/kite_ticker_adapter.py:328-330`)
4. **DQ readiness gate** — extend `pivot-data-quality --date today` to verify
   `strategy_day_state` direction coverage, not just table presence

### Related Files

## 2026-04-13 — MANOMAY live vs replay fill divergence

**Status:** PARTIALLY ADDRESSED — feed audit implemented, deeper analysis pending
**Severity:** High — same symbol, same session, different PnL outcome

### Summary
`MANOMAY` SHORT on 2026-04-13:
- Live session alert: `221.49 → 216.31`, TARGET, `+₹2,253`
- Replay/local-backtest after cleanup: `220.90 → 220.90`, BREAKEVEN_SL, `-₹83.49`

### Root Cause Hypothesis
Live WebSocket path builds 5-min candles from real ticks. Replay/local-live use
candles from `intraday_day_pack` (EOD-built). The historical pack does not
preserve the exact live fill snapshot, so fill prices and bar shapes can diverge.
A single-bar fill drift is enough to flip a TARGET win into a BREAKEVEN loss.

### Fix Applied
`paper_feed_audit` table now stores one compact row per
`session_id + symbol + 5-min bucket`. Compare via:
```bash
pivot-paper-trading feed-audit --trade-date YYYY-MM-DD --feed-source kite
```

### Pending Analysis
- Verify whether WebSocket path falls back to receive-time when
  `exchange_timestamp` is missing or late
- Confirm live volume reconstruction from cumulative `volume_traded` is correct
- Decide whether feed-audit tolerates OHLC drift or whether the live candle
  builder needs a stronger timestamp contract before trusting live-vs-pack parity
- 2026-04-15 audit: large real drift vs `intraday_day_pack` confirmed, mostly in
  volume with some OHLC mismatches (after fixing the bar_start vs bar_end join key)

## 2026-04-16 — paper_positions.exit_reason is NULL for all positions

**Status:** FIXED
**Severity:** Low — data still usable but exit reason audit was missing

### Symptom
All 23 positions from today's LONG and SHORT sessions have `exit_reason=None` in
`paper_positions`. Exit reasons (SL_HIT, TARGET_HIT, TRAIL_STOP, MANUAL_FLATTEN,
BREAKEVEN_SL) were not being persisted to the DB column.

### Root Cause
`update_position` in `db/paper_db.py` accepts two separate keyword arguments:
`exit_reason` (writes `exit_reason` column) and `closed_by` (writes `closed_by` column).
All four close call-sites in `engine/paper_runtime.py` only passed `closed_by=exit_reason`
— the `exit_reason=` keyword was never passed, so the column always stayed NULL.

The `paper_positions` schema has both columns (`exit_reason VARCHAR(50)` and
`closed_by VARCHAR(50)`) — both exist, but only `closed_by` was being populated.

### Fix Applied
Added `exit_reason=<reason>` to all four `update_position` close call-sites:

## 2026-04-15 / 2026-04-16 — Live candle OHLCV diverges from intraday_day_pack

**Status:** ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED — volume bug fixed, residual OHLC drift is architectural
**Severity:** Medium — volume bug caused false mismatches; residual OHLC drift is inherent and
understood. Does not affect SL/target monitoring (uses LTP directly). May cause occasional
entry fill differences vs replay.

### Symptom

Apr 15 feed audit (`pivot-paper-trading feed-audit --trade-date 2026-04-15 --feed-source kite`):
- Total rows: 2433 | Exact matches: 55 | Unmatched: 2342
- Field mismatches: open=1391, high=1262, low=1278, close=1548, volume=2333
- Volume virtually always wrong; OHLC also largely wrong

Apr 16 feed audit (bar-by-bar breakdown):

| Bar | Syms | PriceOK% | VolOK% | Vol Inflated |
|-----|------|----------|--------|--------------|
| 10:10 (first — session started at 10:07, mid-bar) | 1573 | 20% | 0% | 89% |
| 10:15 (first complete bar) | 1596 | 41% | 33% | ~0% |
| 10:20 (steady state begins) | 880 | 76% | 86% | 0% |
| 10:25+ (steady state) | ~877 | 20–100% | 10–100% | 0% |
| 12:25 (flush on stale terminate) | 1581 | 74% | 0% | 87% |

### Root Cause — Two Separate Problems

#### Problem 1: First-tick volume inflation (BUG — now FIXED)

`volume_traded` from Kite WebSocket is cumulative since market open. When the session
connects (e.g. at 10:07), the first tick for each symbol has `prev = None` so the delta
computation fell back to `max(0.0, cumulative)` — attributing ALL pre-session volume
(from 9:15 to 10:07) to the first live bar. This produced volumes 10–1000× higher than
the historical pack. Accounts for the vast majority of Apr 15 volume mismatches (2333/2433).

Same inflation happens at session terminate: flushed partial bars inherit stale
`_prev_cumulative_vol` from the last real tick, so the 12:25 flush bar also had 87%
inflated volume. That data is discarded anyway.

**Fix applied** (`engine/live_market_data.py`): when `prev is None`, leave
`bar_volume_delta = 0.0` instead of using the full cumulative.

#### Problem 2: Residual OHLC drift (~15–25% at steady state) — ARCHITECTURAL, NOT A BUG

Even after the volume fix, ~15–25% of OHLC values differ from the historical pack.
This is an inherent difference between the two data sources — **not a Kite bug, not our bug**.

**Why live WebSocket and Kite historical differ even though both come from Kite:**

| | Kite WebSocket (live) | Kite Historical API (pack) |
|--|--|--|
| What it sends | LTP quote updates — one tick per price change | Full tick reconstruction — every trade aggregated server-side |
| Bar open | First `last_price` tick received after bar start | First actual trade of the bar on exchange |
| Bar high/low | Max/min of ticks WE received | True high/low of ALL trades in bar |
| Bar volume | Cumulative delta between ticks we received | Exact per-bar volume from exchange |

We subscribe in **MODE_QUOTE** (`kite_ticker_adapter.py`). This delivers one WebSocket
update per price change — not every individual trade. In a liquid symbol, 50 trades can
happen in 200ms at different prices; Kite delivers 2–3 ticks covering that burst. We only
see the last price of the burst, not the extremes.

Consequences:
- **Open**: Our first tick after 9:20:00 may arrive at 9:20:02 and may not be the actual
  first trade. The historical API has the exact first trade at 9:20:00.
- **High/Low**: We miss intra-burst price extremes between consecutive WebSocket deliveries.
- **Close**: Usually matches well — last tick before bar end is typically captured.

This is why low-liquidity symbols nearly match (CANFINHOME: entry 857.72 vs 857.72 — exact)
while liquid symbols diverge (ABFRL: our vol=1,788,322 vs historical 33,096 before fix).

**The residual ~15–25% mismatch after the volume fix is not fixable** without switching
the candle source to Kite historical 1-min candles polled every 1–2 minutes, which would
replace WebSocket-built candles with authoritative data.

#### Problem 3: First bar always incomplete (structural limitation)

When the session connects mid-bar (e.g. at 10:07 during the 10:05–10:10 bar):
- OHLC open = first tick received at 10:07, NOT the actual open at 10:05
- All prior trades (10:05–10:07) are invisible

For Apr 16 this affected the 10:10 bar (89% vol inflated, 20% price match). This is
unavoidable — we cannot reconstruct trades we didn't observe. Since entry window is
9:20–10:15 and sessions start before 9:16, in normal operation the first bar affected
is the 9:20 bar (session connects at ~9:07, the 9:15 bar starts at 9:15:00 — we should
be connected before the first trade).

### Impact on Trading

- **SL and target monitoring**: Not affected. SL/target checks use LTP directly from
  WebSocket, not candle OHLC. No fix needed here.
- **Entry signals**: Entry fires on candle close. A 0.1–0.5% open/close divergence may
  occasionally push a symbol across or below the entry threshold compared to historical.
  This explains why the same symbol can show a different entry price or miss entry
  entirely between live and local-live sessions.
- **PnL divergence**: Entry price differences cascade into PnL differences. Expected.
  Example: HGS LONG — live entry 410.75 (TRAILING_SL +₹463), local-live 411.15 (TIME +₹1,089).

### Fixes Applied

1. **Volume inflation** (`engine/live_market_data.py`): First-tick `bar_volume_delta = 0.0`
   instead of `max(0.0, cumulative)`.

2. **exchange_timestamp fallback logged** (`engine/kite_ticker_adapter.py`): DEBUG log
   per batch when receive-time fallback fires. Lets us monitor how often exchange_timestamp
   is missing (missed timestamps near bar boundaries cause bucket misassignment).

3. **Audit tooling** (commits `fcba0ca`, `e3aba01`): `scripts/paper_feed_audit.py` reports
   per-field mismatches (open, high, low, close, volume separately) and is feed-source aware
   (Kite joins on `bar_start`; replay/local joins on `bar_end`).

### Remaining / Future Work

- **Potential improvement**: Poll Kite historical 1-min candles every 60s as authoritative
  candle source for entry decisions; keep WebSocket for LTP-only SL/target monitoring.
  This would eliminate residual OHLC drift at the cost of 60s entry latency.
- Monitor exchange_timestamp fallback rate tomorrow via DEBUG logs.
- Apr 15 zombie gap (11:51–12:17 — no ticks): missing ticks never recovered after
  reconnect — pack has full data, live has a gap. Contributes to the Apr 15 divergence
  count on top of the volume bug.

## 2026-04-17 — Zombie stale check is event-driven; never fires when ticks stop

**Status:** FIXED (2026-04-17)
**Severity:** High — stale detection silently inactive for 22 minutes; positions exposed

### Symptom
Feed went dead at ~11:08 IST. STALE exit fired at 11:30 (1334s stale, 22 minutes).
Apr 16 zombie fix (tick_age > 300 cap) was confirmed in code but did NOT fire.
Both sessions auto-flattened 2 open positions each and restarted unnecessarily.

### Root Cause
The stale watchdog was still running in the session supervision loop, but the
`stale_timeout > 0` guard prevented the zombie path from running when
`stale_feed_timeout_sec` was `NULL` or `0` in the live session row.

That meant a connected-but-silent WebSocket could stay alive far longer than intended
because the "zombie" check was effectively disabled by config.

### Proposed Fix
Keep the watchdog in the existing supervision loop, but always evaluate the WebSocket
zombie path even when `stale_timeout` is unset.

```python
# scripts/paper_live.py — evaluate zombie sockets even if stale_timeout is NULL/0
if use_websocket and ticker_adapter is not None and ticker_adapter.is_connected:
    tick_age = (ticker_adapter.get_stats() or {}).get("last_tick_age_sec") or 0
    if tick_age > 300:
        stale = elapsed > 600
    elif stale_timeout > 0:
        stale = elapsed > max(stale_timeout * 4, 120)
elif stale_timeout > 0 and elapsed > stale_timeout:
    stale = True
```

## 2026-04-17 — Auto-restart creates new sessions instead of resuming

**Status:** FIXED (2026-04-17)
**Severity:** High — open positions auto-flattened unnecessarily; new session is useless post-entry-window

### Symptom
After STALE exit at 11:30, `--multi` restarted both variants with new session IDs:
- `CPR_LEVELS_SHORT-2026-04-17-63b13c` — completed immediately, 0 trades
- `CPR_LEVELS_LONG-2026-04-17-401b74` — completed immediately, 0 trades

Original sessions had open positions (AWFIS, DIXON, VENTIVE, ALGOQUANT) that were
auto-flattened at the stale exit tick price (11:08 IST) instead of monitoring them
to their natural SL/target/time-exit. Dashboard shows the suffixed sessions as the
"latest" but they have 0 trades — confusing and incomplete.

### Root Cause
`paper_live.py` restart logic (line ~1050) always creates a fresh session on restart.
It does not check whether the failed session had open positions that should be resumed.
`--resume --session-id <id>` exists in the CLI but is not used by the auto-restart path.

### Proposed Fix
In the `--multi` restart loop, check if the failed session has OPEN positions in DB.
If yes: use `--resume --session-id <original_id>` instead of creating a new session.
If no (all closed): proceed with a new session as today (entry window check still applies).

```python
# scripts/paper_live.py — in variant restart logic
open_count = await count_open_positions(session_id)
if open_count > 0:
    # resume the existing session — no new entries, just monitor to EOD
    await run_variant_resume(session_id, ...)
else:
    # no open positions and entry window likely closed — skip restart
    logger.info(f"[{session_id}] No open positions and entry window closed — skipping restart")
    return
```

This avoids the premature flatten + useless empty-session restart pattern.

## 2026-04-17 — Dashboard P&L does not match Telegram EOD summary

**Status:** OPEN (proposed fix documented; not yet implemented in code)
**Severity:** Medium — creates confusion about actual daily P&L

### Symptom
Dashboard showed ~₹1,603 mid-session. Telegram EOD showed:
- SHORT: +₹1,208.32 (21 trades)
- LONG: +₹1,432.85 (25 trades)
- Combined: +₹2,641.17

Dashboard figure was lower than EOD final. Root cause not fully pinned — likely a
combination of:
1. Dashboard reads from replica (may lag by 1 snapshot version behind live DB)
2. Mid-session dashboard number included only closed trades up to that snapshot;
   final EOD includes auto-flattened positions from the STALE exit
3. Restarted session (suffix IDs) archived separately — dashboard may aggregate
   inconsistently across original + restart sessions

### Related
Similar issue occurred Apr 16 (doubled archive). The Apr 16 dedup fix prevents
double-counting but does not address cross-session aggregation when a restart
creates a new session_id for the same trade date.

### Proposed Fix
Dashboard "Today's P&L" view should aggregate by `trade_date` across ALL session_ids
for that date (both original and restarted suffix sessions), rather than showing
sessions individually. This way the combined figure always matches the EOD Telegram
total.

## 2026-04-17 — Breakeven exits leaking unrealized profit (strategy observation)

**Status:** FIXED (2026-04-28) — intraday high now triggers TRAIL activation
**Severity:** Low — not a bug; expected behavior but suboptimal P&L capture

### Symptom
Multiple trades hit 1R (triggering `breakeven_r=1.0` → SL moves to entry), ran
further into profit showing large unrealized gains, then reversed back through entry
and exited at ~₹-83 (commission only). Dashboard appeared to show large P&L swings
(₹4,500 → ₹1,603) as these unrealized gains evaporated.

Examples from 2026-04-17: CHEMCON, COSMOFIRST, ASHIANA, DIGITIDE, SBILIFE all
hit 1R, were seen running in profit, then exited BREAKEVEN_SL at ~₹-83.

### Root Cause (Fixed)
`TrailingStop.update()` only checked the candle CLOSE to trigger BREAKEVEN→TRAIL
transition. A candle whose HIGH reaches 2R (trail target) but whose CLOSE stays below
2R never activated trailing. On the next candle, if price reversed below entry, the
trade exited BREAKEVEN_SL despite having had profitable unrealized gains.

Average MFE on BREAKEVEN_SL trades was 2.58R — meaning intraday highs were routinely
reaching/exceeding 2R without activating TRAIL.

### Fix Applied (2026-04-19)
`engine/cpr_atr_utils.py` — `TrailingStop.update()`:

1. **Added `candle_high`/`candle_low` params** — call sites pass full OHLC data.
2. **Trail trigger uses `max(close, candle_high)`** (LONG) or `min(close, candle_low)`
   (SHORT) to detect intraday 2R crossings.
3. **Deferred SL — both trigger paths** — regardless of whether TRAIL was activated by
   candle close or intraday high, the SL stays at entry price for the activation bar's
   `is_hit()` check and tightens on the next bar. This avoids a same-bar ordering
   assumption: a candle that closes through 2R could also have reversed back through the
   tighter stop level within the same 5-minute bar (OHLC order is unknown).
4. **Separate `if` for multi-phase transitions** — changed `elif self.phase == "BREAKEVEN"`
   to a standalone `if`, allowing PROTECT→BREAKEVEN AND BREAKEVEN→TRAIL to both fire on
   the same bar when a single candle crosses both 1R close and 2R high simultaneously.

Call sites updated:
- `engine/cpr_atr_shared.py:445` — `ts.update(close, candle_high=high, candle_low=low)`
- `engine/paper_runtime.py:1709` — same, using candle dict fields

### Backtest Impact (baseline comparison 2025-01-01 → 2026-04-17, full 2044 symbols)

| Metric | Old LONG | New LONG | Old SHORT | New SHORT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| run_id | `a267ead61ffa` | `3898e767c6a9` | `23376249a6ca` | `3c139d78214a` |
| Total P&L | ₹813,889 | ₹893,968 | ₹1,014,394 | ₹1,053,952 |
| BREAKEVEN_SL | 1,130 | 1,107 (−23) | 1,608 | 1,576 (−32) |
| TARGET exits | 741 | 561 (−180) | 1,025 | 1,346 (+321) |
| TRAILING_SL | 264 | 467 (+203) | 322 | 34 (−288) |
| Calmar | 117.2 | 143.1 | 70.0 | 73.1 |

LONG improved significantly (+₹80K, Calmar 117→143). SHORT improved after the
`short_trail_atr_multiplier = 1.25` tuning (+₹41.7K, Calmar 70→73) because more
trades were allowed to continue to the fixed target instead of being clipped by the
trail. See `docs/trailing-stop-explained.md` for the mechanism and the candle-by-candle
examples.

Remaining BREAKEVEN_SL trades (1,107 LONG / 1,575 SHORT) are structurally correct —
trades that reached 1R breakeven but price never went on to reach 2R (high OR close),
so they reversed to entry. These are expected capital-protection outcomes.

### 2026-04-19 RCA: LONG profit regression after trail-timing refactor

After the intraday-high trail fix landed in `95ae448`, the morning LONG baselines
(`e4f3123e8ad7`, `3898e767c6a9`, `206283c94744`, `dcb0f8fd2ddf`) no longer
matched when rerun later in the day. The reruns were still directionally correct,
but they shifted a large number of LONG winners from `TRAILING_SL` back to
`TARGET`, which reduced profit and Calmar.

On 2026-04-20, the baseline set was refreshed again after the shared exit helper
centralization. The new canonical rows are:
`6d3635b36ca3`, `3fba5456e120`, `f0bfbf9074ce`, `be37c0ae2111`,
`38a0b809d8a2`, `f1386c54ca7f`, `99e9d2beca78`, `22d8ca089901`.
These are the only baseline rows retained in `backtest.duckdb`.

  The important nuance is not that intraday-high activation is wrong. The issue is
  the timing of when the tightened stop becomes active relative to the completed
  5-minute bar. The working recovery path is:

  1. Let the completed bar arm TRAIL when its HIGH touches 2R.
  2. Use that completed-bar HIGH as the LONG trail anchor.
  3. Apply the tightened stop immediately after the bar closes.
  4. Make that new stop affect only future bars, not the triggering candle itself.

  That preserves the profit-improving LONG behavior while keeping the engine
  conservative about same-bar OHLC ordering.

  Operational note:
  - Backtest runs can show `save_complete` in the logs and still hold the DuckDB
    writer lock briefly afterwards. The dashboard replica sync is already done at
    that point; the remaining delay is process cleanup / file-handle release.
  - Treat that as a cleanup issue, not a data-sync issue. Investigate the lingering
    writer lifecycle separately from the strategy parity work.
  - The completed-candle exit ordering is now centralized in a shared helper used by
    both backtest and paper/live so the bar-close trailing behavior stays aligned in
    one place.

## 2026-04-18 — Live WebSocket OR values differ from EOD parquet, causing symbol divergence

**Status:** OPEN (root cause confirmed, fix under discussion)
**Severity:** High — 11% symbol overlap between Kite live and local feed; PnL comparison unreliable

### Symptom
Kite live (Apr 17): LONG +₹1,432 / SHORT +₹1,208 = +₹2,641
Local feed (`daily-live --feed-source local`, run after EOD): LONG +₹5,178 / SHORT +₹843 = +₹6,020
Only 5 out of 46 symbols overlapped between the two sessions.

### Root Cause (Confirmed)

**ATR is consistent** — verified all 2030 symbols in `market_day_state` match
`atr_intraday[trade_date=Apr 17]` exactly (ATR from Apr 16's last 14 five-min candles).
The pre-market `pivot-refresh` picks up this row because it was built during Apr 16's EOD
pipeline. ATR is NOT the divergence cause.

The actual root cause: **live WebSocket OR values differ from EOD parquet OR values**.

The Kite live session starts at 09:16 with pre-market `market_day_state` (NULL `or_high_5`,
`or_low_5`, `or_close_5` — no 9:15 candle data yet). At the 09:20 bar (after 9:15 candle
completes), `refresh_pending_setup_rows_for_bar()` resolves direction from live candles and
the fallback in `_hydrate_setup_row_from_market_row()` provides OR values from live
WebSocket ticks.

The Kite WebSocket operates in MODE_QUOTE — one update per price change, not per trade.
In liquid symbols, 50 trades can occur in 200ms at different prices while Kite delivers
only 2-3 ticks. The live 9:15 candle has a **smaller high-low range** than the EOD parquet
(which captures every trade). This produces a **lower or_atr_ratio**, allowing more symbols
to pass the `or_atr_ratio ≤ 2.5` filter.

| Symbol | EOD or_atr_ratio | Filter | Kite live |
|--------|-----------------|--------|-----------|
| CORONA | 4.11 | FAIL | Traded (live ratio ≤ 2.5) |
| NOCIL | 2.90 | FAIL | Traded (live ratio ≤ 2.5) |
| SUNDARMFIN | 2.82 | FAIL | Traded (live ratio ≤ 2.5) |
| ALGOQUANT | 2.28 | PASS | Traded (same) |

This is a manifestation of the known OHLCV drift issue (#7), amplified by the or_atr_ratio
filter which converts small OHLCV differences into binary PASS/FAIL decisions.

### Why Local Feed Uses Different OR Values
The local feed runs AFTER EOD pipeline rebuilds `market_day_state` with actual 9:15 candle
data from `intraday_day_pack` (EOD parquet). These values include all trades, producing
larger OR ranges and higher or_atr_ratio values. The `intraday_day_pack` and
`market_day_state` have identical OR values (verified diff=0.0).

### Parity Requirement
Backtest, paper replay, and paper live should produce the same results for the same date.
The live session's OR values (from WebSocket ticks) are inherently different from EOD
parquet values. This is an architectural limitation of MODE_QUOTE WebSocket feeds.

### Fix Options
1. **Poll Kite historical API during live session**: Replace WebSocket-built candles with
   authoritative 1-min candles polled every 60s. Eliminates drift at the cost of 60s entry
   latency. Keeps SL/target monitoring on WebSocket LTP.
2. **Store live OR values for post-hoc comparison**: After the live session, save the
   OR values used. Local feed can then replay with these exact values.
3. **Accept the difference**: Live trades symbols that the backtest filters out. For
   reliable comparison, compare at the strategy level (overall P&L, WR, Calmar) rather
   than symbol-by-symbol.

### Related Issues
- #7 (OHLCV drift) — same underlying cause, this issue is a specific manifestation
- #1 (OR fields NULL → 0.0) — the Apr 16 fix enabled the live OR fallback
- #8 (live candle OHLCV diverges from intraday_day_pack) — same architectural limitation

## Deferred Parity Follow-Ups

**Status:** OPEN
**Severity:** Medium

These items are intentionally deferred until after the current market-open window. They are
important for long-term parity hygiene, but they are not required to complete the immediate
pre-open workflow.

### 1) Shared daily candidate universe snapshot

Backtest and paper/live still derive their candidate universes from different runtime flows.
The long-term fix is to persist a daily candidate-universe snapshot and have all CPR runtimes
consume the same dated list.

### 2) Backtest vs paper parity re-check for 2026-04-17

Current paper replay/local parity is stable, but the 2026-04-17 paper runs still differ from
the backtest day slice. This needs a follow-up compare after the universe-source alignment is
settled.

### 3) Review lingering backtest writer-lock shutdown

We observed that some long baseline reruns finish saving results before the DuckDB writer lock
fully releases. That does not change results, but it is worth a later cleanup so baseline
reruns exit more predictably.
